					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we experimented with JS events and made a name sorter once again</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main portion of this lab was straightforward because it was pretty similar to what we had done in the past. Task
						X was pretty hard for me though. I decided to make an anagram function, but this was a lot harder than I thought it would be
						I had to figure out how to make a function that could shuffle the letters in my array, I learned how to 
						after searching Stack Overflow. There I learned about the Fisher Yates algorithm, but I wasnt done there. I forgot that for my 
						sort function I made two arrays of shuffled words and I wanted to maintain that feature, so I had to use a nested forloop
						to iterate through both of arrays and shuffle them.
					</p>
			
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Type in the box and click submit to make an anagram of your name!</p>
