					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we created a javascript function that asks the user for their name and sorts it.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While I had no problems with the main task of this lab, I ran into a lot when working on the bonus task. 
					   For the bonus task I moved the userinput outside of the function, styled my output with css, and
					   sorted the name ignoring both case and spaces. While moving the user input and ignoring case was easy, I had a
					   a hard time figuring out how to sort names seperately, ignoring spaces. I was able to do this by first splitting
					   the user input into an array of seperate words and then using the .map method to iterate through the array of words
					   using the .map method to iterate through the array and spliting into seperate arrays of characters, sorting those arrays, then rejoining them.
					   after that I was left with one array with sorted strings, that I joined once more to create a single string. The final thing I had a problem with was 
					   figuring out how to print out specific things in java script instead of printing all of the output in the same place, I was able to fix this by using
					   document.getElementById instead of document.writeln.
					</p>
			
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Overall I had fun working on this assignment, I found the bonus tasks to be a great learning experience.</p>
