			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Subject</h2>
				<p>For this lab, we had to create Pseudocode for a simple computer game</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<h3>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task</h3>
				<ol> 
					<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees</li>
					<li>Take out all the ingredients: butter, sugar, flour, salt, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips</li>
					<li>Take out a bowl, a whisk, a baking sheet, and a spoon</li>
					<li>Melt the butter</li>
					<li>Add sugar to the melted butter</li>
					<li>Mix in one egg and the vanilla extract</li>
					<li>Add flour, baking soda, and salt to the mixture</li>
					<li>Once smoothly mixed, add in chocolate chips</li>
					<li>After the chocolate chips have been evenly folded in, take a spoon scoop out balls of cookie dough, and place them on the baking sheet</li>
					<li>Bake the cookies for 7-10 minutes</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Print the images of rocks,paper, and scissors</li>
						<li>Accept user input</li>
						<li>Have the computer randomly pick between rock, paper, or scissors</li>
						<li>Compare user input and computer choice</li>
						<li>Choose winner</li>
						<li>If it is a tie, the game restarts</li>
					</ol>
				<h3>Task 3: Turn pseudocode into comments</h3>
				<img src = "./img/javascript.jpg" width = 650>
				<pre><code>
//Loop to checking if win condition is met 
//Print out each option: Rock, Paper, Scissors
//Allow the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors
//Have computer randomly select Rock, Paper, or Scissors
//If User and Computer selected the same thing
//Restart Game
//If they are different, choose the winner
//User selects rock and computer selects scissors or User selects scissors and computer selects paper or User selects paper and computer selects rock
	//User wins
//If none of those conitions are met
//Computer wins
