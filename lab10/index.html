					<p>For this lab we experimented with appending the to a div using javascript and jquery</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main part of this assignment was straightforward for me, but task x caused me some problems. Originally I solved part 1 of task 1 by adding an if statment and a counter to check if the number of messages sent was even and 
						then sent messages to left or right depending on their eveness. Once I started step two I didn't like this approach so I got rid of it and created a text box and button and made another listner event for that button
						that would only send messages to the right.
					</p>

				<div id = "results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Click "Say Something" to receive a random text. Type in the text box and click "Send a Text" to send a text message.</p>
